There are almost an endless amount of different songs out there, some more popular and trendy than others. The songs reflect not only the time they were created in, but the creators and listeners as humans, their interests and fundamentally something deeper in their psyche. What makes a song "blow up" then in the information era, especially in a place where everyone, atleast in theory, can upload their music? Are there some common distinguishable elements, that contribute to a song being popular?

This projects aim is to measure, what elements contribute to a song being popular in Spotify. The project workflow follows the CRISP-DM model.

Project is completed in Azure ML Studio.
